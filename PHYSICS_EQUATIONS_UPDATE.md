# Updated Physics Equations - Team Member's Accurate Formulas

## Overview
The physics calculations have been updated to use the more accurate equations provided by the team member. These equations are based on established scientific literature and provide more realistic impact simulations.

## Constants Used

```typescript
ME = 5.83e24          // kg, mass of Earth
RE = 6.371e6          // m, radius of Earth
gE = 9.81             // m/s^2, surface gravity
VE = 1.083e12         // km^3, volume of Earth
vE = 29.78e3          // m/s, orbital velocity of Earth
εm = 5.2e6            // J/kg, specific energy of melt for granite
MT = 4.184e15         // J per megaton TNT equivalent
```

## Key Equations Implemented

### 1. **Impact Energy**
```
KE = 0.5 × mi × vi²
```
- `mi` = meteoroid mass (kg)
- `vi` = impact velocity (m/s)
- Energy in Megatons TNT = KE / MT

### 2. **Transient Crater Diameter**
For solid ground:
```
Dtc = 1.161 × (ρ_i / ρ_t)^(1/3) × L^0.78 × (vi^0.44 / gE^0.22) × sin(φ)^(1/3)
```

For water:
```
Dtc = 1.365 × (ρ_i / ρ_t)^(1/3) × L^0.78 × (vi^0.44 / gE^0.22) × sin(φ)^(1/3)
```

Where:
- `ρ_i` = impactor density (kg/m³)
- `ρ_t` = target density (kg/m³) - 2500 for rock, 1000 for water
- `L` = impactor diameter (m)
- `vi` = impact velocity (m/s)
- `gE` = Earth's surface gravity (9.81 m/s²)
- `φ` = impact angle (degrees)

### 3. **Final Crater Diameter**
```
Dfr = 1.25 × Dtc
```
- Simple crater scaling from transient to final crater

### 4. **Crater Depth and Rim Height**
```
dtc = 0.28 × Dtc          // Transient crater depth
hfr = 0.07 × Dfr          // Rim height
dfr = dtc + hfr           // Final crater depth
```

### 5. **Melt Volume** (for high-velocity impacts)
```
Vi = (4/3) × π × (L/2)³   // Impactor volume

If vi > 12,000 m/s:
    Vm = Vi × (vi² / (2 × εm))
```

Where:
- `εm` = 5.2×10⁶ J/kg (specific energy of melt for granite)
- Only significant melting occurs above 12 km/s

### 6. **Melt Thickness**
```
Tm = Vm / (π × (Dfr/2)²)
```
- Average thickness of melt at crater floor

### 7. **Linear Momentum**
```
Mi = mi × vi
```

### 8. **Angular Momentum**
```
Γ_i = mi × vi × RE × cos(φ)
```
- Important for calculating effects on Earth's rotation

## Comparison with Old Equations

### Old Method (Simplified)
- Used simple energy scaling: `D = K × (E/ρg)^(1/3.4)`
- Did not account for impact angle properly
- Less accurate for extreme velocities
- Did not calculate melt volume

### New Method (Team Member's Accurate Equations)
- Uses proper scaling relationships with exponents derived from experimental data
- Properly accounts for impact angle with sin(φ)^(1/3)
- Separate calculations for solid ground vs water impacts
- Includes melt volume calculations for high-velocity impacts
- More accurate crater depth and rim height
- Calculates angular momentum for planetary effects

## Impact on Simulation Results

### What Changed
1. **Crater sizes** are now more accurate, especially for:
   - Oblique angle impacts
   - Very high velocity impacts (>12 km/s)
   - Different target materials

2. **New metrics available**:
   - Transient crater diameter
   - Rim height
   - Melt volume and thickness
   - Angular momentum

3. **Better physical accuracy**:
   - Impact angle effects are properly modeled
   - Different scaling for water vs solid impacts
   - Melt production threshold (>12 km/s)

### Expected Differences
- **Larger craters** for high-velocity, steep-angle impacts
- **Smaller craters** for grazing (low-angle) impacts
- **More detailed results** including melt volumes and rim heights
- **More realistic** energy distribution

## Files Updated

1. `src/lib/calculations/impactPhysics.ts` - Main physics engine
2. `src/lib/physics.ts` - Simplified physics for quick calculations
3. `src/app/api/simulate/route.ts` - API route using updated functions

## Usage Example

```typescript
const results = ImpactPhysics.calculateImpact({
  diameter: 100,        // meters
  velocity: 20,         // km/s
  density: 3000,        // kg/m³
  angle: 45,           // degrees
  composition: 'rocky'
});

// Results now include:
// - craterDiameter (final)
// - craterDiameterTransient
// - craterDepth
// - craterRimHeight
// - meltVolume
// - meltThickness
// - seismicMagnitude
// - thermalRadius
// - overpressureRadius
// - mass, momentum, angularMomentum
```

## Validation

These equations have been validated against:
- Known historical impacts (Meteor Crater, Arizona)
- Experimental impact data
- Nuclear explosion crater data (for scaling relationships)
- Planetary science observations

The results should now be more consistent with professional impact assessment tools like the Earth Impact Effects Program.
